## Architecture Overview

<h3>RolllPDF is based on the MVVM architecture and the Repository pattern</h3>
<img src="assets/architecture.png"/>

The overall architecture of **RolllPDF** is composed of two layers; the UI layer and the data layer. Each layer has dedicated components and they have each different responsibilities, as defined below:

**RolllPDF** was built with [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture), so it would be a great sample to show how the architecture works in real-world projects.

### UI Layer

<img src="assets/uilayer.png"/>

The UI layer consists of Activity/Fragment that could interact with users and [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) that holds app states and restores data when configuration changes.
- Activity/Fragment observe the data by using [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
